# Fashion Product Images Prediction

## üìå Overview
This project builds a deep learning model that predicts **four attributes** from fashion product images:
- üé® Color  
- üëï Product Type  
- üå§Ô∏è Season  
- üöª Gender  

The model uses a **multi-output CNN architecture with a ResNet backbone**, trained on the [Fashion Product Images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small).

The repo also includes:
- A **FastAPI** backend (`api/main.py`) for inference.
- A **Streamlit web UI** (`ui/app.py`) for image uploads and prediction display.

## üß† Model Details

- **Backbone**: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Outputs**: 4 independent fully connected layers (one per label)
- **Loss**: CrossEntropy for each output
- **Framework**: PyTorch

## Key Files

- **`api/main.py`**  
  Runs the FastAPI server for prediction. Loads the trained model and provides the `/predict` endpoint to infer attributes from an image.

- **`ui/app.py`**  
  Streamlit app for uploading images and displaying predictions by calling the FastAPI backend.

- **`model-training.ipynb`**  
  Contains the model architecture definition (e.g., multi-output CNN with ResNet backbone) and the training.

- **`sample output`**
      Contains the sample output screeenshots of the web ui
- **`label_encoders.pkl`**
     It is necessary for the decoding of model output into the labels

## Downloading and loading the model
- Download the model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BOtH3abvEUHz4scR35o2EHO-2xsbq88C/view?usp=sharing
- paste the path of model in line 71 in api/main.py
   ``` python
  model.load_state_dict(torch.load("output_models/best_model.pth", map_location=device))

## Running the Project

1. **Install requirements:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2.**Run the API server:**

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
3.**Run the Streamlit UI:**
In a new terminal:

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```
Open the Streamlit app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501). Upload an image, and the model will predict fashion attributes by querying the API.
